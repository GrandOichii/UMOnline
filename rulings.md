- If, due to the card's value and any other effects that change it's value (including card effects, character special abilities, terrain bonuses like high ground, etc...) damage is done to the defender during the "During Combat" step, then the attacker wins combat. Otherwise the defender wins combat.

When do attack of defense bonuses from a hero’s ability or map bonus apply during combat?

A: Inherent bonuses are applied between during combat and after combat. In other words, the bonus is applied when the potential damage is being dealt.
